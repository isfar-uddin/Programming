# Programming

Just my collection of solutions from different online judges and coding problems I've solved over time.

I use this repo to practice data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving. Mostly, it's about keeping my skills sharp and learning how to think through tricky edge cases. It's pretty straightforward - solve a problem, commit the code, move on to the next one.

It's fun. And it keeps me in the habit of actually thinking through problems instead of just Googling answers. Plus, revisiting old solutions sometimes shows me how much I've improved (or how messy my code used to be).
